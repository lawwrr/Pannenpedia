    npm install
    npm run gulp && npm run gulp watch

This project uses gulp 4 so you can't just use `gulp` unless you have it installed instead of regular gulp.

You can see posts on `build/index.html`, just reload the page for a new post. Edit js & css on `src` and `src/template` Screenshots are handled via gulp, take one with `npm run gulp webshot`
